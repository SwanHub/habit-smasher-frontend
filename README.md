# Bad Habit Smasher (frontend)

- The concept is self-evident. The goal of this app is self-improvement. They say the best way to kill an issue is with constant pressure and attention. The Bad Habit Smasher app will serve as a monitoring agent for some bad habits I wish to kick. I hope the app evolves into a general self-improvement device of larger personal significance.
